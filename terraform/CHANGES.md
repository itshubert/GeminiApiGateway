# 🎉 Updated Terraform Infrastructure - Simplified!

## ✅ Changes Made

Based on your requirements, I've updated the Terraform infrastructure with the following changes:

### 1. **Removed SQS Queue Deployment** ❌
- Removed the `modules/sqs` module (you're handling queues separately)
- Removed all `QueueSettings__*` environment variables from service definitions
- Removed SQS-related outputs
- Services no longer have queue URLs configured via Terraform

### 2. **Added API Gateway Module** ✅
- Created `modules/api-gateway` to replace your Ocelot gateway
- Configured routes matching your `ocelot.json`:
  - `/products` → Catalog Service
  - `/categories` → Catalog Service  
  - `/orders` → Order Service
  - `/customers` → Customer Service
  - `/inventory` → Inventory Service
  - `/jobs` → Warehouse Service
- Includes `{proxy+}` paths for sub-routes (e.g., `/products/123`)
- Uses VPC Link for private ALB integration
- CloudWatch logging enabled

### 3. **Updated Service Configuration** 🔧
- Removed ALB listener rules (path-based routing now handled by API Gateway)
- Added `listener_rule_enabled = false` to all services
- Removed queue-related environment variables
- Services still use Service Discovery for internal communication

## 🏗️ New Architecture

```

## 📋 What You Get Now

### **API Gateway Routes** (matching your Ocelot config):

| Endpoint | Service | Original Port |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `/products` | Catalog | 4000 |
| `/categories` | Catalog | 4000 |
| `/orders` | Order | 4002 |
| `/customers` | Customer | 4004 |
| `/inventory` | Inventory | 4006 |
| `/jobs` | Warehouse | 4009 |

### **Outputs Available**:
```powershell
terraform output api_gateway_url
# Example: https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1

terraform output api_gateway_service_urls
# Shows individual service endpoints
```

## 🚀 Using the API Gateway

### **Access Your Services**:

**Before (Ocelot - Local)**:
```
http://localhost:5000/products
http://localhost:5000/orders
```

**After (API Gateway - LocalStack/AWS)**:
```
https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/products
https://abc123.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/orders
```

### **Example Requests**:
```powershell
# List products
curl https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/products

# Get specific product
curl https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/products/123

# Create order
curl -X POST https://your-api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/v1/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customerId": 1, "items": []}'
```

## 🔧 Queue Configuration (Your Responsibility)

Since you're managing SQS queues separately, you'll need to:

1. **Create your queues** using your separate Terraform project
2. **Pass queue URLs** to services via environment variables

### **Option A: Use Terraform Variables**

Update your service definitions to accept queue URLs:

```hcl
# In your terraform.tfvars
order_queue_url = "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456/order-queue.fifo"
inventory_queue_url = "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456/inventory-queue.fifo"
```

Then add to environment variables:
```hcl
environment_variables = {
  # ... existing vars ...
  QueueSettings__OrderSubmitted = var.order_queue_url
  QueueSettings__InventoryReserved = var.inventory_queue_url
}
```

### **Option B: Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**

Store queue URLs in SSM and reference them:

```powershell
# Store queue URLs
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name "/gemini/prod/queues/order-submitted" \
  --value "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/..." \
  --type String

# Reference in application code or use Terraform data sources
```

### **Option C: Use Service Discovery**

Services can discover queue URLs at runtime via AWS service discovery or configuration service.

## 📝 Updated Files

### **Modified**:
- ✅ `modules/ecs-service/variables.tf` - Added `listener_rule_enabled`
- ✅ `modules/ecs-service/main.tf` - Conditional ALB listener rules
- ✅ `environments/localstack/main.tf` - Removed SQS, added API Gateway
- ✅ `environments/localstack/outputs.tf` - Updated outputs
- ✅ `environments/aws/main.tf` - Removed SQS, added API Gateway
- ✅ `environments/aws/outputs.tf` - Updated outputs

### **Added**:
- ✅ `modules/api-gateway/` - Complete API Gateway module
  - `variables.tf`
  - `main.tf`
  - `outputs.tf`

### **Removed**:
- ❌ SQS module integration (module still exists but not used)
- ❌ Queue-related environment variables
- ❌ SQS outputs

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. **Link Your Queue Project**

In your separate SQS Terraform project, output the queue URLs:

```hcl
# In your SQS project
output "queue_urls" {
  value = {
    order_submitted_inventory = aws_sqs_queue.order_submitted_inventory.url
    # ... other queues
  }
}
```

### 2. **Pass Queues to Services**

Use Terraform remote state or manual variables:

```hcl
# Reference remote state
data "terraform_remote_state" "queues" {
  backend = "s3"
  config = {
    bucket = "your-queue-state-bucket"
    key    = "queues/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}

# Use in service configuration
module "inventory_service" {
  # ... other config ...
  environment_variables = {
    # ... other vars ...
    QueueSettings__OrderSubmitted = data.terraform_remote_state.queues.outputs.queue_urls["order_submitted_inventory"]
  }
}
```

### 3. **Deploy**

```powershell
cd terraform\scripts
.\deploy-localstack.ps1  # Test locally first
.\deploy-aws.ps1         # Then deploy to AWS
```

### 4. **Test API Gateway**

```powershell
# Get the API Gateway URL
cd terraform\environments\localstack
terraform output api_gateway_url

# Test endpoints
curl $(terraform output -raw api_gateway_url)/products
curl $(terraform output -raw api_gateway_url)/customers
```

## 🔍 Differences: Ocelot vs API Gateway

| Feature | Ocelot (.NET) | API Gateway (AWS) |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Deployment | Container | Managed Service |
| Scaling | Manual | Auto-scaling |
| Cost | Container costs | Pay-per-request |
| Configuration | ocelot.json | Terraform |
| Monitoring | Custom | CloudWatch |
| Authentication | Middleware | AWS IAM/Cognito |
| Rate Limiting | Custom | Built-in |
| Caching | Custom | Built-in |

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Queue Management**:
- ❌ Terraform no longer creates SQS queues
- ✅ You manage queues in separate project
- ✅ Pass queue URLs via variables or Parameter Store

### **Service Communication**:
- ✅ External requests → API Gateway
- ✅ Internal service-to-service → Service Discovery
- ✅ Queue-based events → Your SQS setup

### **Ocelot Gateway**:
- ❌ No longer needed for deployed environments
- ✅ Can still use locally for development
- ✅ API Gateway replaces it in LocalStack/AWS

## 📊 Cost Impact

### **Savings** 💰:
- No Ocelot gateway container ($5-10/month)
- No NAT Gateway data transfer for gateway ($variable)

### **New Costs** 💳:
- API Gateway: $3.50/million requests + $0.09/GB data transfer
- VPC Link: $0.025/hour = ~$18/month

**Net Change**: ~$5-15/month depending on traffic

## 🎓 Testing Locally

### **With LocalStack**:
```powershell
# LocalStack supports API Gateway
localstack start

cd terraform\scripts
.\deploy-localstack.ps1

# Get endpoint
terraform output -raw api_gateway_url
# http://localhost:4566/restapis/abc123/v1/_user_request_/products
```

## 📚 Documentation Updates Needed

I'll need to update these docs to reflect the changes:
- README.md
- QUICKSTART.md  
- MIGRATION.md

Would you like me to update those now?

## ✅ Summary

**You now have**:
- ✅ API Gateway replacing Ocelot
- ✅ Services deployed to ECS
- ✅ No SQS management in this project
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Same route structure as Ocelot

**You need to**:
- 🔧 Manage SQS queues in your separate project
- 🔧 Pass queue URLs to services via variables
- 🔧 Test the API Gateway endpoints

Ready to deploy! 🚀
