# IMPORTANT: Sensitive values (database passwords, certificates) should NOT be hardcoded here.
# Instead, use one of these methods:
#
# Method 1: Load from .env file (Recommended for local dev)
#   Run: .\load-env.ps1
#   Then: terraform plan
#
# Method 2: Set environment variables manually
#   $env:TF_VAR_catalog_db_connection = "Host=..."
#   $env:TF_VAR_certificate_password = "..."
#
# Method 3: Use -var flag
#   terraform plan -var="catalog_db_connection=Host=..."
